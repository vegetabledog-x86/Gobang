# About the cross platform
Qt is a cross-platform framework, and C++ is a cross-platform language, so theoretically it can be run on any platform,including Android, Windows, Linux and MacOS, though I only made a Windows executable file. If you want to use it on your Linux or MacOS devices, you can complain it by using the qmake under your platform.
